# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Libraries such as pandas,numpy,seaborn are used to perform data visualization and descriptive statistics. 
The name of the dataset is Bestseller books. It features column names like "Book Title," "Author," "User Rating," "Reviews," "Rating," "Price," "Year," and "Overall Sales." I attempted to visualise many factors using various visualisation approaches, as well as how each parameter contributes to overall book sales in different years.
